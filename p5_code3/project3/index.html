<h1> Project 3</h1>

<p> (<strong>La di da</strong>) <br>
  This project was actually one of the more fun, personal, and simple projects! Here, we tried to make a clock
  to represent time in a non traditional manner, and in a way that showcases our personal lives. My choice was to make
  a clock based on the music I listen to in my life. You listen to different music when you do different things, when you
  want to experience a different mood, and listen to different music at different times of the day, which I thought
  fit naturally with the idea of a clock. In addition, I thought there were clear ways I could indicate the flow of time
  in a music based presentation, with the volume bar representing the seconds, the song progression representing minutes, and
  the track number being the hour. Even while working, I found that I was able to tell what time it was by looking at my own clock!

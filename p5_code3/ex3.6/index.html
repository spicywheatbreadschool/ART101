<h1> Exercise 4 </h1>

<p> <strong>Run Free!!!</strong> Press mouse to flip the cats!!
    <br> <br> The bounciness of the cats was a happy leftover from the code I was using to test my cat behavior. I had a "test cat" in my draw function and then a cat to test my jumping method, which resulted in an afterimage effect due to the position of the "jumping" cat being updated after the "test cat" was already rendered. So, I applied this logic to all my cats, where it will first draw a cat at their current position, calculate the next position for their jump, and then draw that one too. <br> <br>
    This is a simple project with simple visual elements, but I like how clean it is compared to the things I made in my first project.

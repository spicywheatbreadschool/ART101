             Circles are an awesome shape, so I threw some ellipse statements behind some for loops, and messed around with the parameters until I got something cool. 
             Tiny bit of mental math and a lot of randomization, and this is how it turned out. I took my initial concept from example 1, and added a simple integration of a classmate's square grid code as a background.
              Then, I wanted to further experiment with the "netting" or shading effect to overlay onto the ellipses. <br>

		In this assignment, we combined a few ideas, such as a grid system, and implementing images. I made a grid of alternating money. Then, naturally my mind drifted to Mr. Krabs, and so I discovered that gifs worked as well. <br>
            The most challenging part of this assignment was working with layering, since the canvas "moves" with by constantly redrawing everything. Ordering my functions and finding ways to get things where I wanted was a hassle. <br>

		What makes a brush? Usually, you just make a mark where your cursor is, and then someitmes it has color, sometimes there's a certain edge to it, and an texture you could only achieve with crazy labor. Initially, I put my focus into making simple brushes for lineart, and then ended up with 8 in total, including the 1st "brush".   <br>    
        There are some brushes that make shapes, some brushes that make a blotch where your curses is, and some brushes that I accidentally made in the pursuit of another, that ended up looking really cool.
        I'm satisfied with the "originality" of my brushes; There's a good variety, some are a bit more restrictive and hard to use, yet from what I've managed to create with my examples, there's a ton of potential and freedom at the same time.  <br>
        My brushes weren't made with the idea of cooperating with one another. Each one was honestly its own happy accident, and so there isn't a general "theme" I want them to draw. Also, I didn't want to put in TOO many keybinds. I gave the freedom of hue, saturation, size, and brush. That's enough for you greedy mongrels.  <br>

<h2> Exercise 1 </h2>

<p> 
    This was a first introduction to Javascript and P5, so I ended up playing around without a specific goal in mind. <br>

 </p>
 
 
 <p>
    Still though, I'm really happy with how it turned out. Though the viewer has little control over how the art looks besides increasing the "net" effect, the random variance in circle coloring does help to generate some interesting, trippy visuals.   <br>    
            It simply creates thousands of circles with random colors assigned to them, leading inward to the center. Obscured are more circles in the background and a square grid I had borrowed from a classmate's code.
            I think the amount of detail was really cool. I stumbled upon the net effect by chance, but I think each time it flows over the piece makes it look entirely different. <br>
            figuring out how to use the parameters for the net effect was extremely difficult because it was entirely random variables thrown into an ellipse function. In addition, since there are so many circles rendered, it meant that constantly updating the graphic would be both expensive and seizure inducing.  <br>

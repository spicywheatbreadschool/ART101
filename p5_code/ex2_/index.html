<h1> Sketch X </h1>

<p> (<strong>Artist Sketch</strong>) The goal of this assignment was to learn how to work with images, and some sort of grid. The first image that pops into my mind everyday is MONEY! So, I made a grid of alternating bills, and continued from there. 
    <br> You can press the mouse to flip the image into something else, and you can press spacebar for airhorns! </p>
    <p> <br> The logic behind the alternating bills surprisingly took more effor tthan I thought. In addition, with the way things are layered on the screen, it was a bit tough to work with rendering the images. The Mr. Krabs gif is being updated at a different speed than the background, so when a change happens to the image such as a tint or size change, it changes first, but I decided to leave that in. I'm happy that gifs are not hard to implement in p5. </p>

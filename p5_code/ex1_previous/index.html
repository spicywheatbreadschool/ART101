<h2> Exercise 1 </h2>

<p> 
    This was a first introduction to Javascript and P5, so I ended up playing around without a specific goal in mind. <br>

  This is a recreation of the original code. The netting effect was originally just in initialization, 
  and there was actually no interactivity with the viewer. There was nothing in the draw function. It still looked cool,
  but I defineitly (idk how to spell that) prefer the newer version.

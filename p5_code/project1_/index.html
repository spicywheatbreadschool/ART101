<h1> Project 1 </h1>

<p> <strong>Draw!!! with my brushes. 1-8 are the brushes, and e is the eraser. Press "s" to save. </strong></p>
<p> (for the 1st bush) Press 'r' to reset position to start, 'p' to pause/resume, arrow keys for speed and color adjustment</p>
<p> (For the rest) Arrow Keys control color traits, and brackets for brush size.</p>
    <p> I got caught up making the brushes. It was more fun than I thought. For a lot of my brushes, I had a concept in mind I wanted to execute, and then the code gave me something else. For example, I wanted to use the rotate() function to mess with creating lines, but I'm honestly not sure how it works, but it gave me something entirely different, which was the 4th brush. A lot of my brushes are just simple shapes like ellipses or arcs, then repeated in some subtle different way. <br></p>
    <p> The 1st brush wasn't even intended to be a brush; It was supposed to be my "grid" assignment, but I changed it into a brush instead. I spent a decent amount of time on it. It's just a tool that creates a square at a position randomly, and increments the position so that it looks like it's going row by row. Overall, it was a really fun tool, maybe a bit hard to practically use besides as a background, but still cool. </p>

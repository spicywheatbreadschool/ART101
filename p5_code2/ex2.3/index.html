<h1> Exercise 3 </h1>

<p> (<strong>Kirby.</strong>) It's kirby. Welcome to Dreamland!! </p>
    <p> <br> This one turned out pretty nice. The worst part was dealing with transforms. All the offsets used to create the cat parts were hard coded with numbers, so changing the scale meant the cats would be accordingly scaled from the center. However, there are a ton of numbers I'd have to go and calculate. So it's a feature. Otherwise, I really like how Kirby seems to go forward and back through the space - That was a result of making up a math equation and seeing what happened. The background is pretty simple, but I wanted to go with some soft colors that reminded me of the tone of the Kirby series. </p>

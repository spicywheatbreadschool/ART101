<h1> Project 2 </h1>

<p> (<strong>Trees!</strong>) This was the most frustrating project yet for me honestly. Not from a creative process, but from a technological point. Because we were rendering expensive frames, I suddenly was experiencing memory issues with the recursive trees, and I had to deal with code optimization. Seeing what my work looked liek at any point was a huge drain on time. Even worse, initially I had my video work with iterative addition to values, which meant if I wanted to see what the piece looked like at the end, I had to render all the hundreds of frames. Eventually, I got better at this. <br> The code itself is simple, the code for the recursive trees are nothing crazy. Trying to figure out what values to use for the parameters was difficult since it was pretty abstract what they meant to me.
    <br>
    You can let this page run and see how it renders frame by frame, but it is likely to crash. </p>
